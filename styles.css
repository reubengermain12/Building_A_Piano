/*Now that I have reset the html box model, I need to pass that on to the elements within as well. To do this, I can set the box-sizing property to inherit, which will tell the targeted elements to use the same value as the parent element.

I will also need to target the pseudo-elements, which are special keywords that follow a selector. The two pseudo-elements I will be using are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.

The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.

For now, I've created a CSS selector to target all elements with *, and included the pseudo-elements with ::before and ::after. I've set the box-sizing property to inherit.*/

::after {
